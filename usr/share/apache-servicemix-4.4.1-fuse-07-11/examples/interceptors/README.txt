INTERCEPTORS EXAMPLES
=====================

The interceptors example folder contains two interceptor examples:

1. A custom endpoint listener example (see the /endpoint directory),
   which shows you how to develop and deploy a custom endpoint
   listener that captures and reports, to the ServiceMix
   log, when an endpoint registers and unregisters with the NMR.
   
   For more information on how to run this example, see the
   README.txt file in the /endpoint directory.  
   
2. A custom exchange listener example (see the /exchange directory),
   which shows you how to develop and deploy a custom exchange
   listener that captures and reports, to the ServiceMix log, the
   exchanges that are sent and delivered in the NMR.

   For more information on how to run this example, see the
   README.txt file in the /exchange directory.
